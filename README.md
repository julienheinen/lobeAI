## Lobe

Lobe is an easy-to-use tool that helps you train machine learning models on your own computer, for free, without any prior experience required. It runs locally on both Mac and PC, and you can ship your model to any platform you choose.

[Download](https://github.com/julienheinen/lobeAI/releases/tag/Applications) it for free to get started on your machine learning model today.

## Machine Learning Made Easy

Lobe takes a new humane approach to machine learning by putting your images in the foreground and receding to the background, serving as the main bridge between your ideas and your machine learning model.

Lobe also simplifies the process of machine learning into three easy steps. Collect and label your images. Train and understand your results. Then play with your model and improve it.
